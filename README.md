# Leetcode Problems Filtered and Sorted
List of leetcode questions which can be filtered by multiple tags (array, binary search) at a time and other metrics including  total submissions count, accepted submissions count. The json file storing the parsed problem information is located at './src/assets/problems.json'. Feel free to use it. It will be updated frequently. 

For fetching the problems, I used graphql queries for leetcode inspired from https://github.com/akarsh1995/leetcode-graphql-queries/. 

For any suggestions, please create an issue.
